# horiseon-code-refactor

#Description: 

The codebase for this webpage is refactored to improve the organization of both the HTML and CSS files in a clean concise manner and has been updated to provide user web accessibility. Adjustments were made in regards to the HTML semantic elements. For the most part, upon opennig the file, almost all of the elements were <div>. Several semantic elements were put in place of the <div> elements to improve the codebase for other developers to use. A <nav> element was put in place to establish the unordered list of tag in the navigation bar. The core content is established within the <section> element. Each indivdual self-contained content is defined within the <article> element. The <article> class is consolidated within "subject". An <aside> element is put in place of <div> and the classes are consildated within "benefit". Alt tags were included within each link to provide user web accessability. The CSS file was consolidated to streamline the codebase into a read-friendly format.
